1. Install Python (Basic python skills) > Here is how you install Python?

Installing Python on your computer depends on the operating system you're using. Here are the general steps you can follow for different operating systems:

For Windows:

Visit the Python download page at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Click on the "Download Python" button.
Scroll down to the "Python Releases for Windows" section and select the appropriate installer for your system. Choose the 64-bit version if you're running a 64-bit version of Windows.
Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python.
For macOS:

Visit the Python download page at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Click on the "Download Python" button.
Scroll down to the "Python Releases for macOS" section and select the appropriate installer for your system.
Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python.
For Linux:

Python is usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions. You can check if Python is installed on your system by opening a terminal and running the command "python --version". If Python is not installed, you can install it using the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the command "sudo apt-get install python3" to install Python 3.

Once you have installed Python, you can open a terminal or command prompt and type "python" to start the Python interpreter.
